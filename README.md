# Amphibians-Android-CleanArch
Amphibians is a modern Android application built to showcase a robust, scalable, and testable architecture. The app fetches a list of amphibians from a network source and displays them in a list. This project serves as a demonstration of best practices in modern Android development using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and a Clean Architecture approach.
